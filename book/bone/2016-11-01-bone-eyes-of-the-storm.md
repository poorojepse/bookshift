Lucius, Smiley, and Phoney survive an attack by the rat creatures and return safely to Lucius’ tavern inBarrelhaven. Phoney, desperate to win a bet with Lucius, stokes the townspeople’s fear of dragons andboasts that he is a professional dragonslayer.

Back at the farm, Fone Bone and Thorn are troubled by strange dreams, and Gran’ma Ben’s reaction to them is stranger still: She reveals long-kept secrets and warns of great danger. Thorn, Fone Bone, and Gran’ma Ben may have to leave the farm forever.
