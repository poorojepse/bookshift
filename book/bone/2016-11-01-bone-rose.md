The stirring prequel to the award-winning, bestselling BONE series!

When a terrifying dragon attacks the small towns of the Northern Valley, a young Princess Rose (known later as Gran’ma Ben) must defeat it. 

The beast is actually the ancient evil, the Lord of the Locusts, and while Rose faces danger with honor, her elder sister, Princess Briar, follows a more sinister path.
