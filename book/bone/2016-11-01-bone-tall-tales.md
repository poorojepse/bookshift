Ever wonder what happened before the Bone cousins got lost in the uncharted forest of the Valley? Or how Boneville came to be? This is the hilarious companion to the epic BONE saga.

Long before the Bone cousins were ever lost in the uncharted desert on the outskirts of the Valley, Big Johnson Bone, the discoverer of the Rolling Bone River, founded Boneville. 

But little is known of the mighty explorer’s adventures before he started his famous trading post. So when Smiley Bone sits down with a group of young campers to retell the legendary stories of Boneville’s origin and its tough, no-nonsense founder, what they hear are tall tales in typical BONE fashion–wild antics complete with rat creatures, dragons, and a snarky little monkey!
