"East of West has proven to be one of the most compelling new comic series on the market... its growing number of fans will not be disappointed." - Booklist

This is the world. It is not the one we wanted, but it is the one we deserved. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse roam the Earth, signaling the End Times for humanity, and our best hope for life, lies in DEATH!

In Volume 3 of this bestselling series, "There is no us" sees the breaking apart of the future-scape of America as the world races forward towards the apocalypse.
